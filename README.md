A very simple Lottery game simulation! 

You can easily modify the number of draws simulated by changing the integer within the lotto_draw_simulate() function at the bottom of cell 1.

At the time of publishing this repository, approximately 700 games, or draws, have been played using the current Lotto ball format since October 2015 (https://www.lottery.co.uk/lotto/statistics). If we assume the UK National Lottery draws have indeed remained a consistently random process over that duration, this quick simulation aims to show that there are very slight, non-negligible, biases to each of the 6 sequential ball draws. Note, of course, that these tiny biases change each time the simulation is run, regardless of the total number of draws. 

In other words, if the equivalent real-world data set were to be evaluated, we may find the same such inherent biases. Knowing that information could ever-so-slightly increase your chances of winning the game. An amusing thought ðŸ˜Š but the lottery is ultimately a game of chance.
